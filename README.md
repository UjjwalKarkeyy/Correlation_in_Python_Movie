# 🎬 Movie Dataset Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of movies using Python. It provides insights into the structure of the dataset, handles missing values, and sets the foundation for deeper analysis. The notebook is well-documented and intended for learners or analysts interested in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📌 Future Work (Optional Ideas)

- Perform EDA: ratings vs genres, top-grossing movies, correlation heatmaps
- Visualize with Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Clean and engineer features (e.g., extract release year, convert durations)
- Train a model to predict box office success
